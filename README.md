# ES6-Node.js-Professional-README-Generator
Creates a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Design

* Created command-line application accepts user input.

* When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, professional README.md is generated with: (i) The title of the project; (ii) Description; (iii) Table of Contents; (iv) Installation; (v) Usage; (vi) License; (vii) Contributors; (viii) Tests; and (ix) Questions. 

* When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

* When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

* When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under (at default stays MIT license badge).

* When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

* When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

* When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
